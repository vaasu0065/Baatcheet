## Project Description
BaatCheet is a real-time chat application built with modern web technologies to ensure robust performance, security, and scalability. The application integrates key features like user authentication, real-time messaging, and profile customization, making it an interactive and user-friendly chat platform. This is a personal project created to showcase my development skills on my resume. The project is not open for use, but it is available to view.

## Features

1. **React Application**: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive frontend.
2. **Database**: Integrated with MongoDB Atlas for scalable and secure database storage.
3. **Password Security**: User passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` for enhanced security.
4. **JWT Authentication**: Secured routes with JWT, using cookie parser and decoder for route protection.
5. **Cloudinary Integration**: Used for storing user profile pictures and chat media files.
6. **Protected Routes**: Authentication checks ensure that only logged-in users can access certain pages like the profile update page.
7. **Frontend Libraries**:
   - **React Router DOM**: For seamless navigation between pages.
   - **React Hot Toast**: For user-friendly notifications (e.g., login, signup success, errors).
   - **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI**: For simplified and customizable UI design, including multiple theme options.
   - **Lucide React**: For icons and additional UI elements.
8. **Global State Management**: Managed application state with `Zustand`.
9. **CORS Handling**: Configured for secure cross-origin requests.
10. **Socket.IO**:
    - Built a real-time socket server.
    - Displays online users and provides real-time chat updates.
    - Auto-scrolls to the latest messages in chat.
11. **Real-Time Messaging Workflow**:
    - Messages are first stored in the database.
    - If the recipient is online, the message is sent instantly.
12. **Customizable Themes**: Multiple theme options implemented via DaisyUI for better user customization.

## Technical Highlights

- **Socket.IO Implementation**:
  - Created a `socket.js` file and integrated it with the server.
  - Replaced the app server with a Socket.IO server.
  - Messages are synchronized in real-time between online users.

- **Authentication Flow**:
  - Ensures users are authenticated before accessing protected routes.
  - Includes checks to verify user login status before accessing profile update pages.

- **Frontend Improvements**:
  - Tailored chat UI with DaisyUI for sender/receiver differentiation.
  - Notifications and error handling using React Hot Toast.

## Known Issues (To Be Fixed)

1. **Cloudinary Payload Size Limit**: Large files cannot be uploaded due to payload size restrictions.
2. **Profile Picture Updates**: Users cannot update their profile picture more than once.
